# Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics in Machine Learning and Data Science

Welcome to this repository dedicated to learning the distinction between descriptive and inferential statistics in the context of machine learning (ML) and data science (DS).

## Overview

Statistics are fundamental in ML and DS for understanding and making decisions based on data. Descriptive statistics help summarize and visualize data, while inferential statistics enable us to draw conclusions from data samples. This repository aims to provide a clear understanding of both types of statistics and their practical applications.

<!--## Topics Covered

Our learning journey will include:-->

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Learning to summarize and visualize data using measures like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
- **Inferential Statistics:** Understanding hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, p-values, and their role in predictions and decision-making.
- **Real-world Applications:** Exploring how these statistical concepts are applied in ML and DS scenarios.

Enjoy your journey into the world of descriptive and inferential statistics for machine learning and data science!
